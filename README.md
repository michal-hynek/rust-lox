## Language Specification

### Lexical Grammar
```
expression     → literal
               | unary
               | binary
               | grouping ;

literal        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;
grouping       → "(" expression ")" ;
unary          → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary         → expression operator expression ;
operator       → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
```

### Syntactic Grammar
```
program        → statement* EOF ;
statement      → exprStmt | printStmt ;
exprStmt       → expression ";" ;
printStmt      → "print" expression ";" ;
expression     → equality ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term           → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor         → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
               | "(" expression ")" ;
